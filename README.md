RasterTrace Editor converts raster images into G-code for pen plotting on any G-code-compatible device – modified 3D printers, CNC machines, or dedicated plotters. Generate optimized toolpaths and stream them directly via USB while monitoring the process in real-time.

## Features
-  **Clean UI** – Fast and easy to use interface
-  **Universal Image Support** – Works with all common image formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)
-  **G-code Generation** – Produces standardized G-code compatible with most machine firmwares
-  **Live Feeding** – Monitor and control your machine in real-time with streamed G-Code instructions
-  **Path Optimization (WIP)** – Finds the fastest possible way by minimizing airtime

## Installation
Install the required dependencies to you environment using pip:
```bash
pip  install  -r  requirements.txt
```

### Having issues?
- RasterTrace was tested on **Python 3.12**.
- A working install of **[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)** is required. Which should come pre-installed with modern python versions.
- Replace `requirements.txt` with `lts-requirements.txt`, which installs older versions of the dependencies which have been tested together.

## Quick Start
1. After installing your environment and the required dependencies, enter the `src` directory and launch `python3 main.py`.

3. Enter you machine specifications in the top-right **Configuration** box.

| Option | Description |
|--|--|
| Bed Size (mm) | Dimensions of the machines bed/platform. *(See manual)* |
| Pen Offset (mm) | Offset from original tool (e. g. Nozzle) to Pen Tip.* |
| Pen Z (mm) | **U**p and **D**own z-position of the Pen. |
| Pen Boundary (mm) | Safe Margin from the edges of the bed.** |

*\*Only change if machine is modified. Set this in the machines firmware if permanent.
\*\*Content in the area will be clipped silently.*

3. Select and Load your image in the top-left **Image Selection** box.

4. Move and Resize your image in the center **Canvas** area. The dotted lines represent the machine's bed size

5. Press *Create Plan* in the **bottom-right** and wait for the process to finish. Depending on bed size and image resolution this may take a minute.

6. In the same place, press *View Plan* to open a very rough preview of the result. The actual result usually looks way better.

7. **There are two different options from this point.** The recommended way is to connect your machine via USB to your computer. However, you may also press *Save G-Code* and flash it onto your machine in your own preferred way.

8. Press *Connect Serial* to check the USB connection to the machine.
**Having issues?** Adjust the `SERIAL_PORT` in the top section of `backend.py` and restart the tool.

9. **Finally** press *Begin Motion*, if everything is prepared.
